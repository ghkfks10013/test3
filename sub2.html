      <h3>Original Easter Journey</h3>
      <h4>Tree mouse, active Easter gift for COATIS & CO.</h4>
      <p>Due to the current situation, the Hansan Experience Zoo is closed. In order to help all animal friends survive at the zoo, the zoo regularly releases news about animals.</p>
      <p class="sb5txt">
      In the bright sunshine, the animals searched for a special kind of animal and plant at the Hannover Experience Zoo. The zoo team hid his guardians' favorite foods in paper ice cream and bags. The colorful surprises were to break and conquer with patience.</p>

      <p class="sb5txt1">
      Bears were waiting for colorful bags of fruits, vegetables, and grains. Bears observed socks, hats, and other things for a short time. After learning that "they" were in their reserves, it had already begun: noses in their noses, considered delicious, overturned, looted.</p>

      <h3>THE ZOO'S HISTORY</h3>
      <h4>INAUGURATION IN <span class="sb6txt">1934</span></h4>
      <p>In March 1932, the City of Paris gave the Museum 14 hectares of land in the Bois de Vincennes, near to the Lac Daumesnil. 

      Ménagerie director Professor Edouard Bourdelle drafted the programme. Building work on the zoo was entrusted to Charles Letrosne (who later became head architect for the universal exhibition of 1937). This was to be a modern zoo drawing on the scenic elements of the Stellingen zoo, such as boulders and ditches used to conceal the technical construction work. 

      Yet the aim was not to stage the animals, nor to recreate their habitats by geographical area. A zoological structure, deemed to be the most scientific, was applied, and animals were grouped by family: Ursidae, Felidae, Primates, Ungulates, etc. Work began in 1933. The Paris Zoo was officially inaugurated on 2 June 1934.</p>
